const ROAST = "Wow, with that playlist, it looks like you’re trying to create the world's most mediocre coffeehouse vibe. Coldplay must be thrilled to know you're keeping their stock in the “overly sentimental” aisle afloat while simultaneously trying to vibe with a band named “trauma ray.” Really? Are you trying to soothe your inner sadness with cheery tunes or just trying to see how many turkeys you can fit in one music library? As for \"true love will find you in the end,\" let's be real: it’ll probably find someone with better taste in music first. Score: 68/100."
